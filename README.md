# DealRunner: Dynamic Discount Marketplace

## Introduction
In today's fast-paced and competitive market, businesses often face the challenge of unsold inventory, whether it be empty seats at a movie theater or perishable goods in a restaurant. The inability to adjust prices dynamically based on demand results in lost profit opportunities.

While platforms like Groupon and Honey have attempted to address this issue, they often don't cater to the instantaneous nature of these opportunities. **DealRunner** aims to bridge this gap, offering a real-time platform for businesses to capitalize on these missed sales chances and for consumers to benefit from last-minute discounts.

## Features

- **Personalized Notifications for Users**: Consumers can customize their notification preferences, ensuring they only receive alerts on products and services they're interested in.
  
- **Geolocation-Based Alerts**: By leveraging push notifications on Android devices, we will notify users of discounts on offers near their location, ensuring relevance and increasing the chances of a completed transaction.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with both the merchant and consumer in mind, DealRunner will ensure a seamless experience for listing and purchasing discounted products and services.
